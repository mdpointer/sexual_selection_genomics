# sexual_selection_genomics

We use whole genome resequencing from long-term lines of Tribolium castaneum evolved under manipulated levels of sexual selection, either polyandry or enforced monandry, to test hypotheses around the purging of mutation load by sexual selection.


This project uses the Tcas5.2 reference genome and annotation.
